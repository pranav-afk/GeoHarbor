This Project was a PS from SIF hackathon conducted by ISRO

A little Discription about this App:

GeoHarbor aims to revolutionize Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis by offering a user-friendly and efficient platform. 
One of GeoHarbor's key features is the ability for users to upload their own GIS data formats, including KML, shapefiles, and KMZ files. 
The application supports overlaying thematic layers on maps. This means users can integrate additional layers of information onto a base map, enabling a multi-dimensional view of geographic data(WMS/WMTS ).
Implement essential GIS analysis tools, including intersection, union, buffer or proximity analysis in mobile application.
